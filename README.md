# DLISR
we propose a deep-learning-based interactive service recommendation framework named DLISR, which aims to capture the interactions among the target mashup, selected services, and the next service to recommend. Moreover, an attention mechanism is employed in DLISR to weigh selected services when recommending the next service. We also design two separate models for learning interactions from the perspectives of content information and historical invocation information, respectively, as well as a hybrid model called HISR. Experiments on a real-world dataset indicate that HISR outperforms several state-of-the-art service recommendation methods in the online interactive scenario for developing new mashups iteratively.
